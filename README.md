Here is a small project using AngularJS on front end, and ASP.NET Web API in the backend. The main goal was to create a queue window using AngularJS features, where the user can send a lot of requests to the backend server, and continue working on the application, while the user can see in real time the status of previous request. 

This feature can be used in a lot of scenarios. 

Do you know something good to improve this application? That's awesome, I'm looking forward for your ideas! Just fork this repository and send me a pull request!

### What is this repository for? ###

* In this repository, I am showing more features of AngularJS, a great and awesome MVW framework!
* 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* The front end project uses AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery. But it all set up with CDN :)
* The backend now uses a Entity Framework Code First repository (and no more a .mdf database file attached).
* The backend is a ASP.NET WEB API. I will implement OData soon.
