Here is a small project using AngularJS on front end, and ASP.NET Web API in the backend. The main goal was to create a queue window using AngularJS features, where the user can send a lot of requests to the backend server, and continue working on the application, while the user can see in real time the status of previous request. 

This feature can be used in a lot of scenarios.
